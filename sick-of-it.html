            <h3>Problem space</h3>

            <p>Indecisive audiophiles rejoice.  <strong>Sick of It</strong> aims to combat decision fatigue when looking for new music to listen to.</p>  
                
            <p>The app asks the user to select a color and emoji that resonates with them at that particular moment.</p>
                
            <p><strong>Sick of It</strong> uses those data points to synthesize a playlist through Spotify's API.</p>

            <h3>Tech used</h3>

            <p><strong>Sick of It</strong> uses React for the frontend along with Axios to make calls to Spotify's API.</p>

            <h3>Pain points</h3>

            <p>Spotify's API can be a bit finicky and initially the oauth workflow posed a few issues.  However after building the correct GET and POST methods, I was able to completely solve for those problems.</p>

            <p>The next biggest hurdle in getting <strong>Sick of It</strong> built was making a scoring algorithm to take the user's input and translate it into endpoints that could be used to make an API call to Spotify.</p>
                
            <p>I am ultimately happy with the result, but there are a few improvements that could be made to the algorithm to yield better results from the query.</p>

            <h3>Next iteration</h3>

            <ul id="classic-ul">
                <li>Refactor to make UI mobile-friendly</li>
                <li>Tweak algorithm for better API requests and better playlist results</li>
                <li>Use <code>data</code> HTML attribute to pass user data to query.</li>
            </ul>
